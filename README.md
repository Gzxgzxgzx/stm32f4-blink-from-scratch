# stm32f4-blink-from-scratch

## Basis
I wanted to learn about the STM32F4 from the ground up but couldn't find any unified resources or examples online -- everything uses the vendor libraries which is overkill for such a small demo. It was also important to me that I could do this purely from the command line on a Linux system.

In this repository you will find a unified example. No resources. Sorry :blush:

## Toolchain
* GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain
* [ST-LINK](https://github.com/texane/stlink)
